# LAB 4: Orchestrated deployment of a decomposed application

In this lab we introduce how to orchestrate a multi-container application in 
OpenShift.

This lab should be performed on **workstation.example.com** unless otherwise instructed.

Expected completion: 40-60 minutes

Let's start with a little experimentation. I am sure you are all excited about 
your new blog site! And, now that it is getting super popular with 1,000s of views
per day, you are starting to worry about uptime.

So, let's see what will happen. Launch the site:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e DBUSER=user -e DBPASS=mypassword -e DBNAME=mydb --name mariadb mariadb
docker run -d -p 1080:80 --link mariadb:db --name wordpress wordpress
```

Take a look at the site in your web browser on your machine using 
[http://cdk.example.com:1080](http://cdk.example.com:1080). As you learned 
before, you can confirm the port that your server is running on by
executing:

```bash
docker ps
docker port wordpress
```

and taking look at the "PORTS" column for the wordpress site. You 
can also get your ip address w/ the following minishift command:

```bash
minishift ip
```

However, we have some nice DNS set up and chose port 1080, so you 
can just use [http://cdk.example.com:1080](http://cdk.example.com:1080).

Now, let's see what happens when we kick over the database. However,
for a later experiment, let's grab the container-id right before you do it. 

```bash
OLD_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}' mariadb)
docker stop mariadb
```

Take a look at the site in your web browser or using curl now. And,
imagine, explosions! (*making sound effects will be much appreciated
by your lab mates.*)

```bash
web browser -> http://cdk.example.com:1080 OR curl -L http://cdk.example.com:1080
```

Now, what is neat about a container system, assuming your web application
can handle it, is we can bring it right back up, with no loss of data.

```bash
docker start mariadb
```

OK, now, let's compare the old container id and the new one.

```bash
NEW_CONTAINER_ID=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}' mariadb)
echo -e "$OLD_CONTAINER_ID\n$NEW_CONTAINER_ID"
```

Hmmm. Well, that is cool, they are exactly the same. OK, so all in all, 
about what you would expect for a web server and a database running on 
VMs, but a whole lot faster. Let's take a look at the site now.

```bash
web browser -> http://cdk.example.com:1080 OR curl -L http://cdk.example.com:1080
```

And.. Your site is back! Fortunately wordpress seems to be designed
such that it does not need a restart if its database goes away
temporarily.

Finally, let's kill off these containers to prepare for the next
section.

```bash
docker rm -f wordpress mariadb
```

Starting and stopping is definitely easy, and fast. However, it is still pretty manual.
What if we could automate the recovery? Or, in buzzword terms, "ensure the service 
remains available"? Enter Kubernetes/OpenShift.

## Using OpenShift in the CDK

Now login to our local OpenShift & create a new project:

```bash
oc login -u developer -p developer
Using project "myproject".

oc new-project devel
Now using project "devel" on server "https://192.168.xx.xxx:8443".
```

You are now logged in to OpenShift and are using the ```devel``` 
project. You can also view the OpenShift web console by using the same 
credentials to log in to ```https://cdk.example.com:8443``` using firefox.

## Pod Creation

Let's get started by talking about a pod. A pod is a set of containers that provide 
one "service." How do you know what to put in a particular pod? Well, a pod's containers
need to be co-located on a host and need to be spawned and re-spawned together.
So, if the containers always need to be running on the same container host, well, then 
they should be a pod.

**Note:** We will be putting this file together in steps to make it easier to explain 
          what the different parts do. We will be identifying the part of the file to
          modify by looking for an "empty element" that we inserted earlier and then 
          replacing that with a populated element.

Let's make a pod for mariadb. Open a file called mariadb-pod.yaml.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift
vi ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-pod.yaml
```

In that file, let's put in the pod identification information:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mariadb
  labels:
    name: mariadb
spec:
  containers:
```

We specified the version of the Kubernetes API, the name of this pod 
(aka ```name```), the ```kind``` of Kubernetes thing this is, and 
a ```label``` which lets other Kubernetes things find this one.

Generally speaking, this is the content you can copy and paste between
pods, aside from the names and labels.

Now, let's add the custom information regarding this particular container. 
To start, we will add the most basic information. Please replace the 
```containers:``` line with:

```
  containers:
    - name: mariadb
      image: cdk.example.com:5000/mariadb
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
      env:
```

Here we set the ```name``` of the container; remember we can have more than
one in a pod. We also set the ```image``` to pull, in other words, the container 
image that should be used and the registry to get it from.

Lastly, we need to configure the environment variables that need to be fed from 
the host environment to the container. Replace ```env:``` with:

```
      env:
        - name: DBUSER
          value: user
        - name: DBPASS
          value: mypassword
        - name: DBNAME
          value: mydb
```

OK, now we are all done, and should have a file that looks like:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mariadb
  labels:
    name: mariadb
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mariadb
      image: cdk.example.com:5000/mariadb
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
      env:
        - name: DBUSER
          value: user
        - name: DBPASS
          value: mypassword
        - name: DBNAME
          value: mydb
```

Our wordpress container is much less complex, so let's do that pod next.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift
vi ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-pod.yaml
```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    name: wordpress
spec:
  containers:
  - name: wordpress
    image: cdk.example.com:5000/wordpress
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
    env:
      - name: DB_ENV_DBUSER
        value: user
      - name: DB_ENV_DBPASS
        value: mypassword
      - name: DB_ENV_DBNAME
        value: mydb
```

A couple things to notice about this file. Obviously, we change all the
appropriate names to reflect "wordpress" but, largely, it is the same as
the mariadb pod file. We also use the environment variables that are specified
by the wordpress container, although they need to get the same values as the
ones in the mariadb pod.

Ok, so, let's launch our pods and make sure they come up correctly. In
order to do this, we need to introduce the ```oc``` command which is
what drives OpenShift. Generally, speaking, the format of ```oc```
commands is ```oc <operation> <kind>```. Where ```<operation>``` is
something like ```create```, ```get```, ```remove```, etc. and ```kind```
is the ```kind``` from the pod files.

```bash
oc create -f ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-pod.yaml
oc create -f ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-pod.yaml
```

Now, I know i just said, ```kind``` is a parameter, but, as this is a create 
statement, it looks in the ```-f``` file for the ```kind```.

Ok, let's see if they came up:

```bash
oc get pods
```

Which should output two pods, one called ```mariadb``` and one called 
```wordpress``` . You can also check the OpenShift web console if you
already have it pulled up and verify the pods show up there as well.

If you have any issues with the pods transistioning from a "Pending"
state, you can check out the logs from the OpenShift containers in multiple ways.
Here are a couple of options:

```bash
oc logs mariadb
oc describe pod mariadb

oc logs wordpress
oc describe pod wordpress
```

Ok, now let's kill them off so we can introduce the services that will
let them more dynamically find each other.

```bash
oc delete pod mariadb
oc delete pod wordpress
```

**Note** you used the "singular" form here on the ```kind```, which, for 
         delete, is required and requires a "name". However, you can, 
         usually, use them interchangeably depending on the kind of 
         information you want.

## Service Creation
Now we want to create Kubernetes Services for our pods so that OpenShift 
can introduce a layer of indirection between the pods. 

Let's start with mariadb. Open up a service file:

```bash
vi ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-service.yaml
```

and insert the following content:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mariadb
  labels:
    name: mariadb
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3306
  selector:
    name: mariadb
```

As you can probably tell, there isn't really anything new here. However, you 
need to make sure the ```kind``` is of type ```Service``` and that the 
```selector``` matches at least one of the ```labels``` from the pod file.
The ```selector``` is how the service finds the pod that provides its functionality.

OK, now let's move on to the wordpress service. Open up a new service file:

```bash
vi ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-service.yaml
```

and insert:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wordpress
  labels:
    name: wordpress
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    name: wordpress
```

Here you may notice there is no reference to the wordpress pod at all.
Any pod that provides "wordpress capabilities" can be targeted by this
service. Pods can claim to provide "wordpress capabilities" through their
labels. This service is programmed to target pods with a label of ```name: wordpress```.

Another example of this might have been if we had made the mariadb-service just
a "db" service and then, the pod could be mariadb, mysql, sqlite, anything really,
that can support SQL the way wordpress expects it to. In order to do that, we
would just have to add a ```label``` to the ```mariadb-pod.yaml``` called "db"
and a ```selector``` in the ```mariadb-service.yaml``` (although, an even better
name might be ```db-service.yaml```) called ```db```. Feel free to experiment 
with that at the end of this lab if you have time.

Now let's get things going. Start mariadb:

```bash
oc create -f ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-pod.yaml
oc create -f ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-service.yaml
```

Now let's start wordpress.

```bash
oc create -f ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-pod.yaml
oc create -f ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-service.yaml
```

OK, now let's make sure everything came up correctly:

```bash
oc get pods
oc get services
```

**Note** these may take a while to get to a ```RUNNING``` state as it pulls 
         the image from the registry, spin up the containers, do the OpenShift 
         magic, etc. 

Eventually, you should see:

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mariadb     1/1       Running   0          45s
wordpress   1/1       Running   0          42s
```

```bash
$ oc get services
NAME        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
mariadb     172.30.229.10   <none>        3306/TCP   1m
wordpress   172.30.237.62   <none>        80/TCP     1m
```

Now let's expose the wordpress service by creating a route

```bash
oc expose svc/wordpress
```

And you should be able to see the service's accessible URL by viewing the routes:

```bash
$ oc get routes
NAME        HOST/PORT                         PATH      SERVICES    PORT      TERMINATION
wordpress   wordpress-devel.cdk.example.com             wordpress   80        
```

Check and make sure you can access the wordpress service through the route:

```bash
curl -L wordpress-devel.cdk.example.com
or
point your browser to the URL to view the GUI
```

Seemed awfully manual and ordered up there, didn't it? Just wait til Lab5 where 
we make it a lot less painful!

## Remote Deployment

Now that we are satisfied that our containers and Kubernetes definitions work, 
let's try deploying to "production" on a "deployment" server running Atomic Host.

First, let's log in to the remote cluster:

```bash
oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true \
    -u developer -p developer atomic-host.example.com:8443
```

This will create a new configuration file in ~/.kube/config. This
file stores information about how to connect to the remote OpenShift
cluster.

Let's create a new project in the remote cluster:

```bash
oc new-project production
```

You should now be using the ```production``` project. Let's check the
pods/services:

```bash
oc get pods
oc get services
```

Nothing there, right? Ok, so let's start the bits up on the remote deployment
server. 

```bash
oc create -f ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-pod.yaml
oc create -f ~/workspace/mariadb/openshift/mariadb-service.yaml
oc create -f ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-pod.yaml
oc create -f ~/workspace/wordpress/openshift/wordpress-service.yaml
```

Now we should see similar results as our local machine from:

```bash
oc get all
```

Again, before we access the service, let's expose the route.

```bash
oc expose svc/wordpress
```

```bash
$ oc get routes
NAME        HOST/PORT                                      PATH      SERVICES    PORT      TERMINATION
wordpress   wordpress-production.atomic-host.example.com             wordpress   80        
```

And finally, access the site via the link:

```
curl -L http://wordpress-production.atomic-host.example.com
or
point your browser to the URL
```

As promised, in our [next lab](../lab5/chapter5.md) we'll demonstrate just how simple deployments can be with OpenShift templates.
